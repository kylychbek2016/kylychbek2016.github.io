                            Holds BA in English and Literature from Bishkek Humanities University (Kyrgyzstan, 1998, MS in International 
                            Studies from Oklahoma State University (USA, 2011), Certificates in Entrepreneurship from Israel and Business 
                            and Management from Japan. 
                            25 years of experience in education sector including teaching English to adults and young learners.
                             Taught Talking English in Turkey, the United States, Kyrgyzs tan. He has also been a tutor of TOEFL and GRE. 
                             Recently, Kyle taught English at JustEnglish, a dynamically growing language school in Istanbul. Currently, 
                             he teaches English online to English learners in the United States, Russia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, 
                             and Ukraine. In teaching English to students, Kyle focuses on developing imaginative abilities, so students 
                             start thinking in English without translating their thoughts from their native into English. 
                            This approach allows English learners to improve their speaking skills in a short period of time.
